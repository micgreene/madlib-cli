## Lab 03: Errors, Files, and Packaging

+ *In this app we create a command line application which takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s built in capabilities for reading and writing files.*

### Feature Tasks and Requirements

+ Creates a "Mad Lib" style game via the command line, where the user may insert words to create a funny message

+ Prints a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions

+ Reads a template Madlib file (Example), and parses that file into usable parts.

+ Prompts the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components of the Madlib template.

+ With the collected user inputs, populates the template such that each provided input is placed into the correct position within the template.

+ After the resulting Madlib has been completed, provides the completed response back to the user in the command line.

+ Writes the completed text (Example) to a new file in the repo.
